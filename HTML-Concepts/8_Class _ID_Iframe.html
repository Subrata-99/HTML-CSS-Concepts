<!--
    We have two global properties called id and class

    class: Are use to target and select an element.
    Ids: Are use to target and select an element.

    Now the question is if classes do the same then why do we need ids.

    Id's are mostly used in javascript. When we want reliabilty, all developers come together and made a convension that
    whenever we need to target an unique element we will provide an unique id to the element and target it. Later it daviates from its purpose
    and ppl starts to look at it from css perspective and this process failed.

    Now, most modern frameworks don't produce Ids. They produce unique classes. Now , the classes itself become unique

    So, In general in our basic cases classes can be repeatable but we mostly keep unique ids for each elements.
    
    
    ***iframe: It actually loads webpage inside wabpage. It's not necessarily need to be web page.
       We might want to load youtube video or google map or a small portion of a large page.

       - With Iframe comes security issues so we use as less as possible.
        right now the policies we use mostly are with videos of video players.
    
       - sandbox: This is a important property. It applies extra security or restrictions to the content in the iframe.
        Basically when we are loading web page inside iframe, malicious page can be loaded. To prevent such properties are introduced.
