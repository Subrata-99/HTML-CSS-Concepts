    HTML consists of few keywords like, elements, tags, attributes.

    - The h1 we write like 
        <h1 title="heading1">heading</h1> 
        is an element.

    - at the staring of the element the h1 is our tag name.
    - followed by the the tag name the properties we have are attributes.

    - We can do multi level nesting of elements

    - Theres something called compulsory attributes and non compulsory attributes
    for example inside a tag if we don't put href attribute it doesn't work. So its compulsory attribute.

    <p></p>:
        - theres another tag p tag used to write long paragraphs.
        - theres an emmet syntax for long demo paragraph.
        - example: p>lorem20 -> this will give random lorem paragraph with 20 words
        -br: inside p tag we have br tags for line break.(<br/>)
        -hr: inside p tag we have hr tags for horizontal line breaks(<hr)

    ***There is a important poem problem that comes:  
    <p>
        line1
        line2
        line3
        line4
        line5
    </p> 

    if we write this in html we will not get as this format, we will get like this -> line1 line2 line3 line4 line5
    to make one line after another we have to use multiple br which is very bad.
    in such scenario we use pre tag

    <pre>
        line1
        line2
        line3
        
        line4
        
        line5
    </pre>

    using this way will exactly show the same in browser.

-->
<h1 title="heading1">Welcome</h1>

<p>line1 line2 line3 line4 line5</p>
<pre>
    line1
    line2
    line3
    
    line4
    
    line5
</pre>
