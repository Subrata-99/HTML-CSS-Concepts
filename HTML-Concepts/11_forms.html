    Forms are very very important in html. We can neglect many things of html but forms can never be ignored.
    It doesn't matter how much beautiful our forms are, if their html structure is not right, forms wonn't work.

    Forms are very important in html as through forms user can provide inputs that can be send to servers.

    Bascicaly from element looks like <form action=""></form>
        - Form elements can have multiple input elements(textarea, buttons) but most importantly
        we keep in mind all the input elements inside form will be submitted all together. Not like name email number submitted
        seperately, they will be submitted altogether.

        - action: Now to where the form will be submitted will be decided by action attribute.
        - method: Now forms are of two types declared by method attribute as "get" and "post"
            - If we are to submit data to server we mostly prefer post as the data will be encrypted while submitting.
            - There are also forms where we take data in clear text format, like google seach form (search bar).
            Here while searching we can see whatever we search can be visible in url params.

        - Now we also have input elements inside form. Let's consider input text now
            <input type="text" placeholder="first name" name="" id="" />
            - We know placeholder shows a value until we type anything.
            - Now here is a problem. Alone input tags works fine but sometimes there are some screen readers
            or google seach engines to read these where only placeholders won't work.
            in good practice it's always preferable to have Label tag
            - Label tag just add a label about the input.
            - Now when screen readers come and see label tag, it will understand the input box is of that label( First name).
            Placeholders can not be readable by screen readers.
            - for attribute: inside label tag let us know with which input box it is associated.
                If we use the id of input inside for attribute of label, when we click on label, the cursor will automatically
                point to input box.
                

        - Button: After input text fields if we use a button that can be used to submit data of those input boxes.
            - Usually we use submit button for forms. where we use type attribute as "submit".
            - After providing data inside input fields if we click the submit button, the form will submit.
            
        - accept-charset attribute: this is used to define different language characterset

        - autocomplete attribute: This enables to show or hide suggestions automatically while working with input box

        - enctype attribute: While submitting form, We can define if its multi part, text or application type.
            - text: here we can only use text, no one can add image inside it.
            - muiti part/ form data: that means different types like image add also accepatble.
        - novalidate attributes: Used to submit data without validating.(We don't use this anymore)
        - target:
