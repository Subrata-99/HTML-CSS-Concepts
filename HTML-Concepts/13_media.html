    Basically here we see how we can integrate video and audio in html

    Now basic question comes whats the difference between using iframes and video tags.
    - When we use video tags that means the video we are integrating is in the same server where our html files are residing.
    - But when we are using iframe that means our website opens an window through which 3rd party websites are serving contents.
    That means the load of server is not from our site.

    Video: We can write the syntax like <video src=""></video> or 
                <video>
                    <source src="">
                </video>
        - Whenever we use video we need to provide hight and width.
                 <video width="320" height="240" muted autoplay controls>
                    <source src="./video (240p).mp4" />
                </video>
        - In src attribute we provide the file location
        - autoplay to play automatically and muted to mute the video.
        - Controls to give control over playback and all in video.
        
    Audio: We can write the syntax like <audio src=""></audio>
        Same as video
