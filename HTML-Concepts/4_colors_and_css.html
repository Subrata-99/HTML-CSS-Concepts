    There are multiple ways to put style in css 
    1. inline styles:  already h3 tag is using inline styles
    2. seprate css file: we can use sperate css style and use it inside html by using it inside head tag inside link tag.
    3. Another way can be using style tag inside head.

    Note: as in above file style tag is introduced after link, so being last called element it will override the style.css files properties.
    So the priority of using styles depends on where we are calling.


    Lets say we need to write a quotation. so for that we are using paragraph.
    <p>This is my quote</p>

    But for search engine this quote is just a paragraph. So it won't holds much weightage.
    So, we can instead write,
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            This is my quote
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    writing this way won't change much, we can change the css anytime. 
    But the thing is when we see someones blocked quote in ranked or searched in google, this comes from here.

    -There is also an attribute called cite, for the reference of the quote, it can be website or person or anything
    Now when someone scrolls through our page, they will know the quote is cited by elon mask

    -There are also abbreviation tag in HTML. Its used to define the abbreviation or short form of an element.
    <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

    -There are also assignment tags like
    address tag: provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
    <address>
        <a href="mailto:jim@rock.com">jim@rock.com</a><br />
        <a href="tel:+13115552368">(311) 555-2368</a>
    </address>
    
    cite tag: is used to mark up the title of a cited creative work.
    <cite><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/0.html">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></cite>

    <bdo tag:  There are some tags used for bidirectional use. Suppose we are working with arab clients and they provide some info that should be read from right to left.
