    Long ago, few softwares were famous and among them one was apache2. A simple web software and can be seen in most of the linux systems. Behind all the web pages
    there was apache software which serves the web pages.

    - Now we used to code html one line by one when we were young but in industry we don't do that.
    - For fast coding we use a tool called Emmet, it is given the by default in vs code. for other code editor it might need to be downloaded.

    We often think in html h1 tags comes with big size whereas h2 comes with smaller size. But is not necessaryly true. Because
    by using css we can easily make h2 tag bigger than h1 tag.

    Then comes the natural question why using different tags we can simply use p tag for everything and handle style by css.

    We know HTML is a markup language. But we should remember html as syntactical language too, simple and diclarative language.
    This language helps to make structure of our page. Also there are multiple structured languages like markdown, latex.
    But browser support for html is the most. Thats why it's so much popular.

    Also, each and every tags of html represents their own importance.

    - h1 doesn't mean heading will be big or h2 doesn't mean heading will be small.
    - h1 means all the headings of page are core part of the page.
    - h2 means all the sub headings of page which are second important part of the page.
    - All the web engines understand these core structures very precisely.

    -For example we can write,
    <footer>
        <p>
            .......
        </p>
    </footer>

    So, we can write address inside p tag or even handle footer and place it by css also. Theres no as such problem.

    But, if we write this,
    <footer>
        <address>
            .......
        </address>
    </footer>
    Here we need not to worry about this as google simply understands it's an address tag so it will be easiy for google to list out your address.

    -So, the more we have good understanding of HTML(not for it makes this tag big or this tag small) we can understand the importance of each and every tag and
    the more it helps us to structure our page in better ways.

    -HTML is case insensitive, means we can write head or HEAD, it won't make any problem.

    Understanging few tags =>

  **<!DOCTYPE html> : At the start of internet there wasn't just HTML, also there were, XML, XHTML, Latex etc. So our document can be any type.
    So to let browser know the doc type we use it.

  **<html lang="en> : Now ofcourse as html became popular so we can define the language like if its english or hindi or bengali.

  **-Now the most important part and the main structure of html comes with it's two childs head and body

    <head>
        <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>...</h1>
    </body>

    - When we go to any web page whatever we see are part of our body tag.
    - Whatever we write inside head tag, only two things are visible
        - title
        - Fav icon (the small icon that can be shown on every tabs)
   
  **<meta ... />: We also saw there are meta tags inside head. There are informations that we don't want to show or write on our page
    but if someone comes to our page like server, engines or bot, they should know.
    for example:

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>HTML tutorial</title>
    </head>
    
    - in above example we are using charset="UTF-8", there can be others charset too.
    Like if we want our page to support smiley we can use UTF-16

    - name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", these means,
        - that means when the page by default renders, what will be the zoom level, how will it look on tablets, websites
    - For farther knowledge of all meta tags refer to https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags
