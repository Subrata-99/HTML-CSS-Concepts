    - In html when we comment somthing with comment tag remember in source code it will still be visble inside comment tag

    - Suppose we have a h3 tag and iside that I want to make a specific word bold and for that we use b tag
        <h3>This is <b>Important</b></h3>

        We will notice that nothing will change as h3 by default make information bold.
    - Now we can change h3 to p and lets see.  
        <p>This is <b>Important</b></p>
        
        Now this will work as we get only important as bold.

    - Now if we have bold tag then whats the use of strong tag ?
        again here comes the basics of html, it gives our site structure and provide symantics.
        we used to write bold as there wasn't much css heavy work back then.
        
        But in modern days we don't use bold, we only bold something to strongly emphasize that information on our website.
        Thus strong tag is used.
        So, better approach is <p>This is <strong>Important</strong></p>

    - Similarly we have i tag for italic <p>This is <i>Important</i></p>
    - Similarly we have em tag for emphasized text <p>This is <em>Important</em></p>
    - Similarly we have small tag for making small text <p>This is <small>Important</small></p>

    -sub: specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript -> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
    -sup: element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript -> a<sup>2</sup></var> + <var>b<sup>2</sup>

    -del: element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. Usually looks like strike through texts.
        There is <del>nothing</del>
    -mark: element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference
        <p>my name is <mark>Subrata</mark>

    -style: This attributes use to make inline style,  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Make me center</h3>
